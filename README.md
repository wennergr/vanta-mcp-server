# Vanta MCP Server

A <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.com/"> Model Context Protocol </a> server that provides access to Vanta's automated security compliance platform. Vanta helps organizations achieve and maintain compliance with security frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, and others through automated monitoring, evidence collection, and continuous security testing. This MCP server enables AI assistants to interact with Vanta's API to retrieve compliance test results, manage security findings, and access framework requirements.

> **⚠️ Important Disclaimer:** This server provides AI assistants with access to your Vanta compliance data. Always verify the accuracy and appropriateness of AI-generated responses before taking any compliance or security actions. Users are responsible for reviewing all outputs and ensuring they meet their organization's security and compliance requirements.

## Tools

| Tool Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `get_tests`              | Retrieve Vanta's automated security and compliance tests. Filter by status (OK, NEEDS_ATTENTION, DEACTIVATED), cloud integration (aws, azure, gcp), or compliance framework (soc2, iso27001, hipaa). Returns test results showing which security controls are passing or failing across your infrastructure. |
| `get_test_entities`      | Get specific resources (entities) that are failing a particular security test. For example, if an AWS security group test is failing, this returns the actual security group IDs and details about what's wrong. Essential for understanding exactly which infrastructure components need remediation.       |
| `get_frameworks`         | List all compliance frameworks available in your Vanta account (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP, PCI, etc.) along with completion status and progress metrics. Shows which frameworks you're actively pursuing and their current compliance state.                                                    |
| `get_framework_controls` | Get detailed security control requirements for a specific compliance framework. Returns the specific controls, their descriptions, implementation guidance, and current compliance status. Essential for understanding what security measures are required for each compliance standard.                     |
| `get_controls`           | List all security controls across all frameworks in your Vanta account. Returns control names, descriptions, framework mappings, and current implementation status. Use this to see all available controls or to find a specific control ID for use with other tools.                                        |
| `get_control_tests`      | Get all automated tests that validate a specific security control. Use this when you know a control ID and want to see which specific tests monitor compliance for that control. Returns test details, current status, and any failing entities for the control's tests.                                     |

## Configuration

### Vanta OAuth Credentials

1. Create OAuth credentials from the <a href="https://developer.vanta.com/docs/api-access-setup"> developer dashboard </a>
2. Save the `client_id` and `client_secret` to a env file:
   ```json
   {
     "client_id": "your_client_id_here",
     "client_secret": "your_client_secret_here"
   }
   ```

> **Note:** Vanta currently only allows a single active access_token per Application today. [More info here](https://developer.vanta.com/docs/api-access-setup#authentication-and-token-retrieval)

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add the server to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vanta": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@vantasdk/vanta-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "VANTA_ENV_FILE": "/absolute/path/to/your/vanta-credentials.env"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you are unfamiliar with setting up MCP servers in Claude Desktop, [here is an example](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) in the official MCP documentation.

### Usage with Cursor

Add the server to your Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Vanta": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@vantasdk/vanta-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "VANTA_ENV_FILE": "/absolute/path/to/your/vanta-credentials.env"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `VANTA_ENV_FILE` (required): Absolute path to a file containing JSON OAuth credentials
- `REGION` (optional): API region - `us`, `eu`, or `aus` (defaults to `us`)

## Installation

### NPX (Recommended)

```bash
npx @vantasdk/vanta-mcp-server
```

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g @vantasdk/vanta-mcp-server
vanta-mcp-server
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VantaInc/vanta-mcp-server.git
cd vanta-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Build from Source

To build from source:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:

1. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
2. Make the output executable
3. Place built files in the `build/` directory

Now you can configure your Claude Desktop or Cursor to use the built executable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Vanta": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/vanta-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "VANTA_ENV_FILE": "/absolute/path/to/your/vanta-credentials.env"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Debugging

You can use the MCP Inspector to debug the server:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @vantasdk/vanta-mcp-server
```

The inspector will open in your browser, allowing you to test tool calls and inspect the server's behavior.

## Example Usage

### Get failing AWS tests for SOC2

```typescript
{
  "tool": "get_tests",
  "arguments": {
    "statusFilter": "NEEDS_ATTENTION",
    "integrationFilter": "aws",
    "frameworkFilter": "soc2",
    "pageSize": 50
  }
}
```
